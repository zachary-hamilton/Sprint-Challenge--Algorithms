#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The run time is O(n) linear
    a is increasing by n*n for each run through the while loop
    since it is increasing by (n*n) it will no longer be less than 
    n*n*n after n times. This is (n*n) * n 

b) The run time is O(n*.5n) exponential
    As n increases the number of iterations of the while loop will increase by 1
    In addition, the length of each while loop will increase by 1 every other
    increase in n


c) The run time is O(n) linear
    as bunnies increases by 1 the code will go through one additional level of
    recursion
